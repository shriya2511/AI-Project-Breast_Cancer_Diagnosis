# AI-Project-Breast_Cancer_Diagnosis

The goal of this project is to significantly compare different classification learning algorithms 
in predicting the possibility of a patient having breast cancer.

Technologies used: 
  Jupyter notebook for Implementation
  Anaconda environment 
  Language of implementation: Python 
  Inbuilt python Libraries for data pre-processing 
  Machine learning models for obtaining the accuracy of prediction 
  Plotly and matplotlib to obtain visualization of the obtained results


TO evaluate the model, we used the accuracy score metric. We compare around 9 supervised learning algorithms to predcit model accuracy. 
In conclusion, we found that the most suitable model for our datset was the Ada Boost Algorithm. 

On running the code, it will display the model accuracy and comaprsion between their performance via visualizations.
